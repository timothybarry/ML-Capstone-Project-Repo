        <p>Pertussis, historically known as whooping cough, is a very serious respiratory infection caused by the pertussis bacteria. It can cause violent coughing fits. Whooping cough is most harmful for young babies and can be deadly.

            <br><br> "Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, tiny germ-laden droplets are sprayed into the air and breathed into the lungs of anyone who happens to be nearby."

            <br><br> "Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe. 
              After cough fits, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breaths, which result in a “whooping” sound. Pertussis can affect people of all ages, but can be very serious, even deadly, for babies less than a year old."</li>

            Predicted line has a shallow slope that shows a decreasing pertussis outbreak rate as the vaccination rate increases. 
            Looking at the distribution of the training data plotted we can infer that the correlation between vaccination rate and pertussis cases is not very strong.

            Because the scatter plot of the linear regression seems to show a clusters of low incident and high incident, we decided to also do a logistic regression to predict outbreak vs. no outbreak. 
            The plot of the regression data shows a higher probability of no outbreak as the vaccination rate increases, which is what we expected.

            <p>Factors that prevented a stronger model for predicting Pertussis outbreaks:
            <ul>
              <li>We used kindergarten vaccination rates as representing the overall vaccination rate for each county’s population. This does not account for those who relocated to counties after kindergarten age.</li>
              <li>Immunity from either vaccination or having Pertussis is not life-long. This also weakens the use of kindergarten vaccination rate as representative of the general population.</li>
              <li>Year to year changes in kindergarten vaccination rates only relates to a small portion of the population and does not reflect the same amount of change in the general population vaccination rate. </li>
            </ul>

            To improve prediction model:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Look for more features to include in the model that contribute to the spread of pertussis.</li>
              <li>Use social media feeds to detect possible incidents of pertussis.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Population density of county or biggest city in county</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Provide more comprehensive education to parents about the benefits of vaccination</li>
                <li>Allow only medical exemptions for non-vaccination in schools</li>
                <li>Create a state/national registry of medical exemptions with issuing physician</li>
                <li>Establish legislation that disciplines physicians for issuing exemptions for payment</li>
                <li>Establish legislation at the state level that requires schools to track and report vaccination information – with possible financial incentives or penalties</li>
              </ul>

              <strong>A parting thought…</strong> 
              <br><br>
                When parents chose to not vaccinate their child, they place at greater risk persons who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, those who are too young to be fully vaccinated, and others for whom vaccines do not provide complete protection.
